# JavaScript-Fundamentals-Part-2
This is my learning curve with JavaScript.

This is a part 2 of my JavaScript journey. I will keep tracking my progress.

In the future, I will redo all the assignments and challenges for practice. I can not wait to see my progress!

Basic HTML file called index.html

JavaScript file called script.js (which contains the lectures and the coding challenges)

Other JavaScript file called assignment.js (contains all the assignments)

Watchout JavaScript... here I come!
